  ## Description
  **Paragraph 1: Assignment Description**

In this challenge, we were  tasked with building an API for a social network web application using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for database storage, and Mongoose ODM for modeling the data. The goal is to create an API where users can share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list. The challenge emphasizes the use of NoSQL databases like MongoDB to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.

**Paragraph 2: Motivation**
I took on this challenge to enhance my skills in building robust and efficient APIs using modern web technologies. By creating a social network API, I aimed to gain practical experience in working with NoSQL databases, handling complex data relationships, and implementing various HTTP methods for CRUD operations.



**Paragraph 3: Problem Solving**

During the development process, I focused on designing clear and logical API routes that adhere to RESTful conventions. I implemented user authentication, data validation, and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. Additionally, I optimized database queries and used Mongoose features effectively to enhance the API's performance.
  ## Usage
  **Paragraph 4: Lessons Learned and Purpose**

This project provided valuable insights into working with NoSQL databases, modeling complex data structures, and ensuring data integrity in a social networking context. Through this challenge, I honed my problem-solving skills, learned best practices for API development, and gained a deeper understanding of MongoDB and Mongoose.

- **Command-Line Applications:** I gained experience in building command-line applications using Node.js. Handling user input and generating output in a terminal environment was a fundamental skill I developed during this project.

- **File Manipulation:** The project involved dynamically creating and updating files in Insomnia. I learned how to programmatically generate API: Get, Push, Put, Post and Delete.

  Installation and How to Test
To set up the project locally and test the API routes, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <https://github.com/lo-mido/social-network>
Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

Copy code
npm install
Start the server:

sql
Copy code
npm start
Use a tool like Insomnia or Postman to test the API routes as described in the assignment guidelines. Ensure that the API endpoints function correctly and handle various scenarios effectively.

Bonus Feature
One of the bonus features implemented in this project is the automatic deletion of a user's associated thoughts when the user account is deleted. This ensures data consistency and prevents orphaned thoughts in the database.
